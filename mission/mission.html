      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        At JIRCZ, our mission is to ensure that every individual and family has access to safe, stable, and affordable housing. 
        We work to break the cycle of housing insecurity by connecting people with resources, advocating for equitable housing policies, 
        and building partnerships that create sustainable solutions. Our goal is simple yet urgent: to make housing a human right, not a privilege.

      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Our organization began with a small group of volunteers who saw firsthand how unstable housing can uproot lives and limit opportunities. 
        What started as a neighborhood initiative—helping families cover rent and navigate complex housing systems—grew into a movement to address 
        the root causes of homelessness and insecurity. Each success story we’ve witnessed has reinforced our belief that with compassion, advocacy, 
        and action, lasting change is possible.

      <h2>Our Vision</h2>
      <p>
        We envision a future where no one has to wonder where they’ll sleep at night. 
        In our communities, housing will serve as a foundation for dignity, health, 
        and opportunity—not as a barrier to them. By building stronger networks of support 
        and challenging systems that perpetuate inequality, we aim to create a world where safe and stable homes are accessible to all, regardless of income or circumstance.
