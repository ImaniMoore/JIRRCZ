          I've heard some rumors about nonprofi executives making a lot of
          money. Does CRIZ leaders make millions?
        </h3>
        <p>
          We wish! As a team of apprentices, the only millions we’re handling
          are the ideas we brainstorm each week. No one at CRIZ is rolling in
          cash our focus (and our funds) go straight into helping people find
          stable housing Our leadership is compensated fairly and responsibly,
          following nonprofit standards and overseen by our volunteer board of
          directors. So, while we may not be millionaires, we’re definitely rich
          in purpose.
